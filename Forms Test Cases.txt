There would be additional steps to these tests to verify that, once you completed the form, the data you entered was saved, but I don't currently see how I can get that data, so ignoring those parts for now

Forms Tests page
	There are a bunch of test cases that could be written around the static content of this page, correct image, correct text, google account displayed, the 'Draft saved' message, etc. Listing out all of those would be dozens of tests and I get the feeling I'm already going overboard based on the time limit established for this test, so leaving them for now.
